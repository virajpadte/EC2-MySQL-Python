# EC2-MySQL-Python
My plan is to build a simple workflow to try and get a python code to work with a remote MySQL database hosted on AWS EC2 instance.


Currently added the python to remote MySQL simple access and commit example snippets.

I will soon be adding on some reference links to install mysql on AWS EC2, create IAM roles and allow incoming traffic on certain ports for ensuring security.
